[Intro]
Ooh-oh-oh
How would you like to ghosted, baby

[Verse 1]
One day I was riding my spacehorse 'round the spaceship
When a buzzer went off we got called to a meetin'
They suspected that I was the imposter and said
That they'd be sure to give me one hell of a deletin'
And that's when my girl to me rejected
Right after that I got ejected
Guess that today is just just not my day
I'm not the imposter but they ejected me anyways

[Chorus]
How would you like to be ejected out of a moving
Forced to float around, helplessly
How would you like to be seperated from you friends
How would you like to ghosted, baby
Cause, damn, I got ghosted today

I got ghosted today

[Verse 2]
Now I forced to be a ghost and float around
Can't make an oto, no sound, can't even touch the heckin' ground
Wish I could get back my body, if only I wasn't dead
Cause there's still some stupid imposter chopping off people's heads
I wish that I didn't get ghosted, baby
All my friends back in the city gonna roast me, baby
Now who the heck is gonna toast me, baby
This song's genre is rap and country, baby

[Chorus]
How would you like to be ejected out of a moving
Forced to float around, helplessly
How would you like to be seperated from you friends
How would you like to ghosted, baby
Cause, damn, I got ghosted today

[Verse 3]
I've been watching what's going on inside of the spaceship
They're going through my stuff and then they're stealing all my... things
Why'd they have to do this? Why'd they have to do it?
I'm not bad, thought they knew that, but no, guess it turns out that they don't.
And even if I had my guitair, wouldn't really be able to play it
Cause, ya know, I'm dead, don't you laugh, don't you dare say... anything
I wish that I had real hands instead of ghostly ones
So I could steal back my tractor and drive it around through the mud...
YEE-HAWW
I wish I had my cow, so I could milk her, she's a fun one to do
I wish I had my saw, so that I could cut wood, and see the beauty, too
Wish I had my pocket knife, so I could, at least go make some weird carvin'
There's one thing good that came out of death - I'm no longer starvin'!

[Chorus]
How would you like to be ejected out of a moving
Forced to float around, helplessly
How would you like to be seperated from you friends
How would you like to ghosted, baby
Cause, damn, I got ghosted today

[Verse 4]
This sucks, this sucks, this isn't good
I want me tools, so I can get under the hood
Of my truck, just my luck, that I can't even touch
Nothing else rhymes, except for I'm not Dutch, uh!
What is going on down there?
They're still all hiding in fear!
I thought they would need me and my company
But no, apparently they do fine without me there!

Somebody save me, come ressurect me
And when you do, don't you dare eject me
No, not again

(You heard the man this time, no ejections or you get broken spine, uh!)

[Chorus]
How would you like to be ejected out of a moving
Forced to float around, helplessly
How would you like to be seperated from you friends
How would you like to ghosted, baby
Cause, damn, I got ghosted today

[Bridge]
My horse just died because she got nobody to feed her
Oh the nerve of them, they couldn't even let me keep her
What's a cowboy who was sus in Among Us, gonna be able to do
To get out of this little inconvience, oh shoot
I don't know what will happen next
But we must keep movin' on, like the length of this song
Cause we just have to live life like a wheat farm with pesticides
Like a tractor with no gas, a truck with no motor oil
But we can't, cause just like boots need their spurs, a cowboy needs his cowgirl

[Chorus]
How would you like to be ejected out of a moving
Forced to float around, helplessly
How would you like to be seperated from you friends
How would you like to ghosted, baby
(Doesn't feel really good)

How would you like to be ejected out of a moving
Forced to float around, helplessly
How would you like to be seperated from you friends
How would you like to ghosted, baby
Cause, damn, I got ghosted today

Woah-oh
I got ghosted today
How would you like to ghosted, baby

[Outro]
(If you can't beat it back, then beat it in)
(Don't let them eject you, friend)
(Cause we all have something to defend)
(But I got)

How would you like to ghosted, baby
(Woah-oh)
