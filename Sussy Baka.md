[Chorus]
You look like you play Among Us
Anta wa saashi baka
Red is look sus, impostaa
You such a sussy baka
Nante saashi baka

[Verse 1]
I don't know what the hell I'm saying
All I know is that Among Us is the game I'm playing
Damn it, my brain is stuck way back in 2021
Among Us maybe dead, but sus is still red
With imposters around betraying
Anybody ever learn their Japanese?
Sussy baka's sussy idiot, so ligma deez
Don't know what to put in this song, so wrong
Can't be long, so beat it kid and suck my- lollipop!
Totemo saashi baka I know I saw you vent
Shine, konoyarou! I saw just where you went
Raitto wa hikaru janai, naze? I've got a good guess
Ore no bengoshi wa one of the best (Woof!)

[Chorus]
You look like you play Among Us
Anta wa saashi baka
Red is look sus, impostaa
You such a sussy baka
Nante saashi baka

[Verse 2]
I'm pretty sure you sabotaged
The oxygen tanks sitting in the garage
You think you can get the hell away with that?
Well soon your life will just be a mirrage
All I have to do is freakin' catch you in the act
And boom, show the crew, you're done just like that
So stop killing people like an overspoiled brat
You gonna be a dead body, floating ghost, that facts
Uh! Hit the buzzer, (beep)
Min'na, come close, kore wa kuruu mitinggu
Yeah guys, he's the impo- wait, WHAT ARE YOU DO?!
Kare wa akaii janai, he's freakin' blue!!
"I saw him by the panel when the lights blacked out,"
"He was standin' by a vent and he ran when I shout!"
"Let's throw this blue perpetrator off, I've got zero doubt!"
What on this spaceship are you i-
(beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep)
Blue was not the imposter... KU-

Kare wa saashi baka, it's obviously red
Boku kureji janai! I'm not over my head
Akaii o iijekuto shite, please before we're all dead
Mite, bakaya- kuso! You just missed him vent!

[Chorus]
You look like you play Among Us
Anta wa saashi baka
Red is look sus, impostaa
You such a sussy baka
Nante saashi baka

[Verse 3]
Why the kuso you ejecting green?
There's nothing he did that you've seen!
He fixed the lights making everything bright
Impostaa janai, come on, don't you trust me?
See, he's ejected and ofc lights are dark again
Don't worry, I'll fix them, they'll be on in 10
Ten seconds that is, unless that's when
Red comes up and stabs my a-, that case I'm dead
So I kinda need an escort to kinda come with me to
The electrical room but I guess we need more than two
Otherwise ya'll think that I'm the true sussy baka in here
The answer is, let's go fix the lights, then grab a freakin' beer
So come on, dare, anybody wanna come an escort me?
I know that two and enough for you, so come on group of three
Just two people to come with me or if you prefer the entire crew
So then we can hopefully catch red unless he sabotaged security
Oh no, what the hell now? Oxygen is flowing out!
Somebody get over and fix it, immediately!
Losin' air like I lost my original Peace Treaty!
Demo Pisu Turiiti wa kuso if we're all dead,
There's smth you can pull out of your bottom... it's called your head!

Ike, kono supeessoshippu wa losin' air fast
Akaii wa kuruumetto janai, that's fact
kare wa kiiraa, demo, I got yo back
Nan ji desu ka? Sore wa time to kick some- butt!

[Chorus]
You look like you play Among Us
Anta wa saashi baka
Red is look sus, impostaa
You such a sussy baka
Nante saashi baka

[Outro]
Akaii wa... iimpaastaa...
HOORAA-
...janai.
What?! Damn it!

And they all died. The end.
