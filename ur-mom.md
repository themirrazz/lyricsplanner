[Person 1]
Hey, biatch, ur mom just keeps on getting fatter!
She can't play baseball bc she gon squish the ball and the batter!
At this rate, in just 5 months, she be bigger than Saturn!
She's obnoxiously gianormus, that it makes her all the chatter!

[Person 2]
Hey, now listen here! We both know that crap ain't true!
My mom's the best and she ain't fat, so let me tell you the real truth!
Your mom's a little ugly, that's an understatement, though...
Black holes won't suck her because her ugliness, you foe!

[Crowd]
BURN!

[Person 1]
Okay, what the hell? We both know my mom's deluxe!
Yours is so annoying at this point, nobody gives a... crap!
Anyways, you look exactly like your mom, oh my Chaos, I can see the resembelence.

[Person 2]
Aw, thank y-

[Person 1]
You're ugly. It wasn't a compliment.

[Crowd]
BIGGER BURN!

[Person 1]
Your mom's so cheap she can't even afford a private school.

[Person 2]
Nope, your mom's so physically broken she made a child that's uncool.

[Person 1]
Hey! Watch it, also what the hell do you mean by that?!

[Person 2]
She's so broken she mutated your brain cells and made you a spoiled brat.

[Person 1]
Okay, so then tell me, why would a private school take such a bratty girl?

[Person 2]
For the money. Plus, your mom needed to hide you from the world.

[Person 1]
Okay, that's it, you're going down sister! (Falls on ground)

[Person 2]
Seriously? You thought child of perfect mom could be brought down by the child of a blister?
Wow, you're even lamer then I though!
But hey, I guess after all, you did inherit some proper genes from your mom!

[Person 1]
Guess your mom was too dumb to teach you that's not how genetics run!

[Person 2]
While, like I said, mom botched you up, while her and dad were having fun.
But hey, don't worry, I assure it's not her fault!
She passed her broken physical traits to you that's all!

(Ding ding!)
