```
[Chorus]
I thought that I could trust you but it turns out that I can't
I told you all my secrets, and you just stabbed me in the back
Despite color I thought that maybe you and me could be friends
But what else was I expecting, because you're red

[Verse 1]
I believe in you there was a kernel of good hiding somewhere
Maybe you had the soul of yellow, like the popcorn, floating through the air
But only because you sabotaged oxygen and the gravity
Nobody else had proof because you also killed security
Oh, I didn't wanna believe it was you
All the good times, all the things we went through
But then, we got the proof
And it killed me, that's on you.

[Chorus]
I thought that I could trust you but it turns out that I can't
I told you all my secrets, and you just stabbed me in the back
Despite color I thought that maybe you and me could be friends
But what else was I expecting, because you're red
