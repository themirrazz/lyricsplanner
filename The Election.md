```
[Chorus]
The button got pressed, so we had an election
Voted red off the ship, baby, they got ejected
But then the in-game screen came up and told me
They weren't the imposter and it needed to be corrected

[Verse 1]
Got 1 man down, thought that red was really it
But no, apparently, red was who fixed lighting and... yeh
So we're running around looking for imposters by inspecting vents
But as I looked through one it broke, and I fell in
