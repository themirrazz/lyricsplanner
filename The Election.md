[Chorus]
The button got pressed, so we had an election
Voted red off the ship, baby, they got ejected
But then the in-game screen came up and told me
They weren't the imposter and it needed to be corrected

[Verse 1]
Got 1 man down, thought that red was really it
But no, apparently, red was who fixed lighting and... yeh
So we're running around looking for imposters by inspecting vents
But as I looked through one it broke, and I fell in
So I climbed back out cause I didn't know what to do
And then blue fell down too
This time everyone saw it
Saw blue fall right to the vent
So we had a meetin' and you'll
Never guess what happened next
(Or maybe you will)

[Chorus]
The button got pressed, so we had an election
Voted blue off the ship, baby, they got ejected
But then the in-game screen came up and told me
They weren't the imposter and it needed to be corrected

[Verse 2]
People running around in circle
Everyone suspected purple
After all he always stole food from the cafeteria
People were getting super paranoid
Took mug shots with a polaroid
And then stuff started to rise into hysteria
(And we all got malaria)
So then, one day, everyone spied on purple
He went over to security and stood there for 10 secs
The taskbar ain't go up, we looked security was sabotaged
So everyone said we now know who to eject
(Or do we?)

[Chorus]
The button got pressed, so we had an election
Voted pur'le off the ship, baby, they got ejected
But then the in-game screen came up and told me
They weren't the imposter and it needed to be corrected

[Verse 3]
At this point in our life we were in fright
Because nobody we've ejected was the right
So wouldn't you be too
People were so scared
That they started runnin' around bare
And now I'm double scared, cuz, ew!
So in the fright, we shed some light
No not yellow, we suspected white
And then we kicked him off our ship
As we yelled "We're done with this- with this"

[Chorus]
The button got pressed, so we had an election
Voted white off the ship, baby, they got ejected
But then the in-game screen came up and told me
They weren't the imposter and it needed to be corrected

[Bridge]
Hey, it's been longer than a week, maybe a month or two
We just voted of the last person besides me - cyan blue
And that's when I came to the sad realization, but true
I was the imposter the whole time - and in my sleep I killed my crew

[Chorus]
I pressed the button, but nobody to have election
Self-voted me off the ship, oh baby, I got ejected
And the in-game screen came up and told me
That I wasn't the imposter, and it needed to be corrected

[Outro]
So I looked, around, floated as a ghost
To see, two people, having a toast
They were grey and cream
Something that I'd never dream... of
Because I didn't even know that those colors existed except gray
And I didn't know that you could use the black-white in the game
Oh, what a day

(Imposters won.)
