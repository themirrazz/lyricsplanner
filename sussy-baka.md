[chorus]
You look like you play Among Us
Anta wa saashi baka
Red is look sus, impostaa
You such a sussy baka
Nante saashi baka

[Verse 1]
I don't know what the hell I'm saying
All I know is that Among Us is the game I'm playing
Damn it, my brain is stuck way back in 2021
Among Us maybe dead, but sus is still red
With imposters around go around betraying
Anybody ever learn their Japanese?
Sussy baka's sussy idiot, so ligma deez
Don't know what to put in this song, so wrong
Can't be long, so beat it kid and suck my- lollipop!
