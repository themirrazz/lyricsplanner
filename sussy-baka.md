```
[chorus]
You look like you play Among Us
Anta wa saashi baka
Red is look sus, impostaa
You such a sussy baka
Nante saashi baka

[Verse 1]
I don't know what the hell I'm saying
All I know is that Among Us is the game I'm playing
Damn it, my brain is stuck way back in 2021
Among Us maybe dead, but sus is still red
With imposters around betraying
Anybody ever learn their Japanese?
Sussy baka's sussy idiot, so ligma deez
Don't know what to put in this song, so wrong
Can't be long, so beat it kid and suck my- lollipop!
Totemo saashi baka I know I saw you vent
Shine, konoyarou! I saw just where you went
Raitto wa hikaru janai, naze? I've got a good guess
Ore no bengoshi wa one of the best (Woof!)

[chorus]
You look like you play Among Us
Anta wa saashi baka
Red is look sus, impostaa
You such a sussy baka
Nante saashi baka

[Verse 2]
I'm pretty sure you sabotaged
The oxygen tanks sitting in the garrage
You think you can get the hell away with that?
Well soon your life will just be a mirrage
All I have to do is freakin' catch you in the act
And boom, show the crew, you're done just like that
So stop killing people like an overspoiled brat
You gonna be a dead body, floating ghost, that facts
