[Chorus]
Taking an interstellar ride on the Skeld
But hey now, you guys kinda mighta wanna yield
If you don't you may not exist, killer in our midst
Yeah you heard me, there's an imposter on the Skeld

[Verse 1]
Flyin' through the Skeld, flyin' through deep space
Everything and everyone is in their assigned place
Until, Boom, boom, bam whiz! Uh-oh, damn it!
Something's happened and the lights don't work. What a jerk!
So you run to electrical, without bein' hysterical
You try to match the wires and doin' it correctly, ya'll
But then up from behind you, before you can do a move
Comes a guy, you can't tell who it is, but he kills you
Oh shhh- blue found the dead body and reported it!
But he can't do nothin', y'all don't know who the killer is.
Sorry, purple, but your time's over, you train wreck
And blue, since you reported, well, you gonna be next!

[Chorus]
Taking an interstellar ride on the Skeld
But hey now, you guys kinda mighta wanna yield
If you don't you may not exist, killer in our midst
Yeah you heard me, there's an imposter on the Skeld

[Verse 2]
You're blue now, walkin' in the cafeteria
Looking to download huge craploads of secret data
And I sneak behind you, you're dead now, RIP
Just kidding!
